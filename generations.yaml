    description: "The first-generation MG ZS compact crossover SUV played a crucial role in MG's global market expansion under SAIC Motor's ownership. It featured a distinctive design with the 'London Eye' headlights, diamond-pattern grille, and flowing character lines. Dimensionally, it competed in the compact crossover segment with a length of approximately 4.3 meters. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a 1.5-liter naturally aspirated four-cylinder producing around 106 horsepower or a 1.0-liter turbocharged three-cylinder generating approximately 111 horsepower. Transmission choices included a 5-speed manual, 6-speed manual, 4-speed automatic, or 6-speed automatic depending on engine and market. The interior offered a surprising amount of space for its class, with features uncommon at its price point including an 8-inch touchscreen infotainment system (with Apple CarPlay on higher trims), a panoramic sunroof on premium variants, and synthetic leather upholstery options. Safety features included stability control, hill-start assist, and a tire pressure monitoring system, though advanced driver assistance systems were limited. The ZS established itself as a value proposition in the competitive compact crossover segment, contributing significantly to MG's sales growth in markets such as the UK, Thailand, Australia, and India. In 2019, the ZS EV was introduced, representing MG's first all-electric vehicle, with a 44.5 kWh battery providing a WLTP range of approximately 163 miles."

    description: "The refreshed MG ZS received substantial styling updates and technology improvements while maintaining the same fundamental platform. The exterior adopted a more modern design language with a larger hexagonal grille, redesigned LED headlights with new daytime running light signatures, revised bumpers, and updated taillights connected by a chrome strip. The interior saw significant enhancements including a larger 10.1-inch floating touchscreen with improved graphics and functionality, a redesigned instrument cluster with a larger digital display, and upgraded materials throughout the cabin. The powertrain lineup was updated in many markets to include a new 1.3-liter turbocharged engine producing approximately 161 horsepower and 230 Nm of torque, paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission, offering improved performance over the previous engines. The 1.5-liter naturally aspirated option continued in some markets with refinements for better efficiency. Technology features expanded to include a 360-degree parking camera system on higher trims, enhanced connected car features, and improved smartphone integration. Safety was enhanced with the addition of MG Pilot, a suite of advanced driver assistance systems including adaptive cruise control, lane keep assist, traffic jam assist, intelligent high beam control, and autonomous emergency braking on higher specifications. The ZS EV also received updates with a larger 51.1 kWh battery extending range to approximately 198 miles (WLTP) and later a 72.6 kWh Long Range version with up to 273 miles of range. The refreshed ZS continued MG's strategy of offering competitive features and technology at accessible price points, helping the model maintain strong sales performance in an increasingly crowded segment."
